# ClonksCodingLib.GTAIV
 ClonksCodingLib.GTAIV is an extension to the [ClonksCodingLib](https://github.com/ClonkAndre/ClonksCodingLib) library which contains useful functions for [IV-SDK .NET](https://github.com/ClonkAndre/IV-SDK-DotNet)  
 This structure of this library is similar to ScriptHookDotNet, so that people who have created mods for GTA IV using ScriptHookDotNet, have an easier time switching to IV-SDK .NET.
